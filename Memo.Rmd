**Introduction**

Nowadays, right business strategy is more important than product itself. In this project, we mainly analyzed the cereal sales data of our company and our two main competitors -- Kelloggs and Post. In order to provide the most effective business strategy and create highest revenue for our company, we analyzed the sample of 21850 observations of cereal weekly sales from several stores. After focusing on sale units (number of cereal packages sold), sales price (price per package), flavor (cereal flavor group), in store promotion (Yes/No), advertising volume (None/Small/Medium), we found that in store promotion and advertising volume have apparent affect on increasing sales revenue. And it is important to give appropriate promotion discount and apply wise advertising strategy based on different cereal flavors, which help us increase competitiveness and minimize unnecessary expenditures. In our analysis, we used the centrality of numeric data (median) to avoid bias which created by extreme values.

**Findings**

We found that promotion can increase revenue. According to the point graph below, we can find that the median revenue increased after promoting. To be specific, toasted flavor created the highest median revenue \$`r toasted_rev_no` before promotion and \$`r toasted_rev_yes` after promotion, which are all higher than our competitor Kelloggs' maximum median revenue. Also, according to our calculation, we found that cocoa flavor has the highest revenue increase rate `r cocoa_pct`\% after promoting, which implied that it is still necessary to give promotion on cocoa flavor. Moreover, we also explored the range of price discount for promotion, which is from `r initial_pct`\% to `r adjusted_pct`\%, and the median revenue range will be \$`r rev_w_pro_41pct` (with `r adjusted_pct`\% discount rate) to \$`r rev_w_pro_5pct` (with `r initial_pct`\% discount rate).

# Quantitative data by producer and ad

  group_by(producer, ad) %>%
  summarise(med_units = median(units),
            med_price = median(price),
            med_revenue = median(revenue))
prod_ad
gm_ad_med_none_dif <- prod_ad$med_revenue[3] - prod_ad$med_revenue[1]
k_ad_med_none_dif <- prod_ad$med_revenue[6] - prod_ad$med_revenue[4]
p_ad_med_none_dif <- prod_ad$med_revenue[9] - prod_ad$med_revenue[7]

# Group by ad and flavor -- General Mills Only
# Calculate the revenue increase rate on each flavor after promoting advertising
GM_ad_fla_rev <- cereal_sales %>%
  filter(producer == "GENERAL MILLS") %>%
  group_by(ad, flavor) %>%
  summarise(med_revenue = median(revenue)) %>%
  spread(ad, med_revenue) %>%
  mutate(GM_none_vs_small = (Small-None)/None * 100,
         GM_small_vs_med = (Medium-Small)/Small*100,
         GM_none_vs_med = (Medium-None)/None*100)
GM_ad_fla_rev
cocoa_small_ad <- GM_ad_fla_rev$Small[2]
cocoa_medium_ad <- GM_ad_fla_rev$Medium[2]
```

We also found that appropriate advertising volume can increase sales revenue. According to our analysis, the median revenue of our cereal sales increased by \$`r gm_ad_med_none_dif` if advertising volume changed from none to medium. Under the same condition, our competitor Kelloggs only increased by \$`r k_ad_med_none_dif`, and Post only increased by \$`r p_ad_med_none_dif`. However, is it really necessary to launch the same advertising volume on each flavor? After further exploration, we found that launching medium volume advertising on cocoa flavor decreased the median revenue from \$`r cocoa_small_ad` to \$`r cocoa_medium_ad` (see below).

**Conclusion and Recommendations**

In conclusion, we found that promotion and advertising are closely related to revenue, and all these two factors can increase revenue. To be specific, we would recommend that if giving promotion sales only, we can provide price discount on four flavors since they all contributed to revenue increase. If launching advertising only, we would recommend launching medium volume advertisments on cinnamon toast, regular, and toasted. We can launch small volume advertisments on cocoa flavor, which will save costs for us. If we combine promotion and advertising together, launching median volume advertising and providing promotion can bring the most benefits to our company (please refer to graph "Max Median Revenue Strategy"). In this way, our cereal sales can exceed our competitors Kelloggs and Post.
